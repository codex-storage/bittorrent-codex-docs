2. **qBittorrent**: This open-source client is another popular choice, especially among users looking for an ad-free experience. qBittorrent receives around **6 million visits monthly**, with most users coming from countries like China, the United States, and Russia. It’s particularly popular with younger users, with over 35% of its visitors aged 25-34 .
3. [[Deluge (BitTorrent)]]: Although smaller, Deluge remains popular with an estimated **272,800 monthly visitors**. The majority of its users are from the United States, Brazil, and France. It attracts a similar age demographic as other clients, with a strong preference among those aged 25-34 .
