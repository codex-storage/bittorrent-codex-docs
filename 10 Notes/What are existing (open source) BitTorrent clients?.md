On Wikipedia we can get a decent overview of [[Learn BitTorrent|BitTorrent]] clients: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_clients.

Three BitTorrent clients stick out based on their popularity and feature set:

- [[qBittorrent]]
- [[Transmission]]
- [[Deluge]]

We summarise them all shortly in [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients]].
