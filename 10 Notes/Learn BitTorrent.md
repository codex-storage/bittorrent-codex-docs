In order to imagine, what do we mean by *BitTorrent - Codex Integration*, we need to gain some basic understanding of BitTorrent. This is no time nor space to create a comprehensive introduction to BitTorrent here (we need to learn it as we go), so, here I just gathered some resources I use to understand the protocol, and by doing it to understand what does it mean for Codex to integrate with BitTorrent clients.

### Specs

BitTorrent spec is build incrementally from so called [BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals (BEPs)](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0000.html). Each BEP adds something to the BitTorrent Protocol. The most important BEPs to study in order to get a good initial grip on the BitTorrent protocol are:

- [BEP3 - The BitTorrent Protocol Specification](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html)
- [BEP5 - DHT Protocol](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html)
- [BEP9 - Extension for Peers to Send Metadata Files](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html)
- [BEP10 -Extension Protocol](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html)
- [BEP23 - Tracker Returns Compact Peer Lists](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0023.html)
- [BEP29 - uTorrent transport protocol](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html)

### Papers

Selection of some more important BitTorrent papers:

1. [[Incentives Build Robustness in BitTorrent]]
2. [[The Bittorrent P2P File-Sharing System - Measurements And Analysis]]

### Books

Not so many decent books about the BitTorrent protocol. You can find some *publications* from Springer and occasionally IEEE that focus on some aspects of BitTorrent or its performance.

Below some recommendations:

1. [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]]. Community book, free.
2. [[BitTorrent chapter from book P2P and Grids to Services on the Web]].


### BitTorrent Token

Not sure how to categorise this, especially it is just in the area of the BitTorrent ambitions. Yet, clearly, they want to be on the same market as we are: [Whitepaper](https://www.bittorrent.com/btt/btt-docs/BitTorrent_(BTT)_White_Paper_v0.8.7_Feb_2019.pdf).
