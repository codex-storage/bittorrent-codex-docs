On Wikipedia we can get a decent overview of [[Learn BitTorrent|BitTorrent]] clients: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_clients.

> It should be noted here, that Wikipedia sources are often quite outdated.

From this comparative, it does feel appropriate to further constraint our research to the following three clients:

- [[qBittorrent]]
- [[Transmission]]
- [[Deluge (BitTorrent)]]

All clients have similar capabilities and provide a similar set of features. Looking at look-and-feel of the website, Transmission looks the most attractive. If I would be a regular, non-dirty-hacker user, I would be attracted by [[Transmission]]. Other clients feel to me more niche, yet I would put [[qBitTorrent]] on the second position. [[Deluge (BitTorrent)]], still potentially attractive, with significantly lower user-base, being quite feature complete, still looks a bit ”hackie”. Both [[Deluge (BitTorrent)]] and [[qBittorrent]] depend on [[libtorrent-rasterbar]], while [[Transmission]] is using its own BitTorrent protocol implementation.
