Dated 10-Jan-2008, [BEP52](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html) describes `v2` of the BitTorrent protocol. Below I attempt to enumerate the most important changes.

> I am not trying to be exhaustive, not very precise here, as we will basically focus on the version 2 of the protocol. If we want to support `v1` we will learn it better while working on it.

### ChatGPT clarifications

### Question 1

Ok, let’s now switch to BitTorrent v2 (BEP52: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html).

Can you summarise the differences between BitTorrent protocol version 2 (BEP52) and version 1 (BEP3)?
#### Answer

BitTorrent v2 (BEP52) introduces several key improvements over the original BitTorrent protocol (v1, as defined in BEP3), focusing on enhanced security, data integrity, and efficiency. Here’s a summary of the main differences:

1. **Piece Hashing and Integrity**:

	- **V1 (BEP3)**: Uses SHA-1 hashes for each piece. The entire torrent is hashed as one, and the `info_hash` is an SHA-1 hash of the “info” dictionary.

	- **V2 (BEP52)**: Switches to SHA-256 hashes, providing stronger security. V2 introduces merkle trees for piece verification within each file, which allows smaller hashes and more flexible integrity checks. Each file has its own hash tree, improving the handling of multi-file torrents.

2. **Improved Data Integrity with Merkle Trees**:

	- **V1**: Uses a single SHA-1 hash per piece, stored sequentially in the .torrent file, meaning each piece’s hash is validated individually but does not connect them hierarchically.

	- **V2**: Uses merkle trees for each file, storing SHA-256 hashes in a hierarchical tree structure. This allows peers to verify individual pieces more efficiently without needing all hashes, which is particularly helpful for partial downloads.

3. **File-Based Hashing**:

	- **V1**: In multi-file torrents, only pieces are hashed, not individual files, meaning no direct file-level validation.

	- **V2**: Each file is hashed independently, creating a separate merkle tree for each. This enables file-level validation, so files can be verified independently, improving integrity and security for multi-file torrents.

4. **Hybrid Torrents (Backward Compatibility)**:

	- **V1**: Not applicable; designed with no forward compatibility.

	- **V2**: Supports hybrid torrents, which are torrents compatible with both v1 and v2 clients. Hybrid torrents contain both SHA-1 (for v1) and SHA-256 (for v2) hashes, allowing legacy and v2 clients to participate in the same swarm.

5. **Reduced Hash List Size for Large Files**:

	- **V1**: The .torrent file stores a linear list of hashes, which grows with the number of pieces.

	- **V2**: By using merkle trees, V2 stores only a root hash for each file, significantly reducing the size of the hash list for large files. Peers can request only the relevant parts of the tree they need for validation, which is more efficient.

6. **Improvements in Piece Alignment and Flexibility**:

	- **V1**: Pieces are aligned across files, meaning a piece can contain parts of multiple files, which complicates file validation and partial downloads.

	- **V2**: Pieces are aligned to individual files, meaning each piece belongs to a single file. This makes it easier to download and verify single files within a multi-file torrent.

7. **Increased Security and Reduced Collision Risk**:

	- **V1**: Uses SHA-1, which is now considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.

	- **V2**: Uses SHA-256, which provides significantly stronger security against collisions, helping protect the integrity of torrents and reducing the risk of hash collisions.

##### Summary Table

| Feature                | BitTorrent v1 (BEP3)           | BitTorrent v2 (BEP52)            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Hash Algorithm         | SHA-1                          | SHA-256                          |
| Piece Hashing          | Linear hash list per piece     | Merkle trees per file            |
| File-Level Integrity   | Not supported                  | Supported with file-based hashes |
| Backward Compatibility | None                           | Hybrid torrents supported        |
| Hash List Efficiency   | Linear growth with pieces      | Reduced size with merkle trees   |
| Piece Alignment        | Spans multiple files           | Aligned per file                 |
| Security               | Weaker (SHA-1 vulnerabilities) | Stronger (SHA-256)               |

These improvements in BitTorrent v2 (BEP52) focus on enhancing data integrity, security, and efficiency, especially for larger torrents and multi-file torrents. Hybrid torrents further ease the transition, allowing v2 and legacy clients to coexist within the same swarms.
