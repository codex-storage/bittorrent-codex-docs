| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Here I include some clarifying notes. I found the BitTorrent documents’ language quite far from being formal and it looks like one can only learn the detail by looking into some “reference” implementation (currently that reference is most probably [[libtorrent-rasterbar]]).

Before doing that, I used ChatGPT to see how much clarification we can get with its help. It looks that ChatGPT has pretty good “understanding” of BitTorrent and one can find its explanations way more formal and precise than the original spec (or it is just more intelligent than I am…). Thus, in this section I include some conversations with ChatGPT including my questions (which I want to believe also capture some interesting points). I am providing a similar transcript for the [[Protocol v2 clarifications]], and for [[BitTorrent DHT clarifications]].
