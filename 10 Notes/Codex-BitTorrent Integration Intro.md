Let's gather some background data about [[Learn BitTorrent|BitTorrent]] clients. This is something that ChatGPT is quite good at so I compiled a bit of data you can easily check for yourself. If something looks funky, please feel free to adjust and clarify, but just for having quick check of where we are, it seems to be a reasonable overview. I also saw @Giuliano Mega immediately jumping into [[Deluge]] (also @Mark sees that as a good start), so for my personal conviction we are diving into the right thing I wanted to have some arguments on why - however short and imprecise it is not.

The most popular BitTorrent clients as of recent years include:

1. **qBittorrent**
	1. Open-source and ad-free, qBittorrent is a favorite among users looking for a lightweight yet powerful client.
	2. It offers features like torrent prioritization, scheduling, and built-in search.
2. **uTorrent (µTorrent)**
    1. A widely used client, µTorrent is known for its small size and ease of use.
    2. While it’s feature-rich, the free version has ads, and some users prefer alternatives due to concerns about bundled software.
3. **BitTorrent**
    1. The official client from BitTorrent Inc., it shares many similarities with µTorrent since the same company owns both.
    2. It’s user-friendly and offers both free and paid versions with additional features.
4. **[[Deluge]]**
    1. An open-source client known for its extensive plugin support, making it highly customizable.
    2. It has a simple interface and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
5. **Transmission**
    1. Lightweight and open-source, Transmission is especially popular on macOS and Linux.
    2. It has a minimalistic interface and can be controlled via the command line or a web interface.
6. **Tixati**
    1. A lesser-known option but well-regarded for being fast and powerful.
    2. It’s free, ad-free, and has detailed information on torrent health and peers.
7. **BiglyBT**
    1. An offshoot of the once-popular Vuze, BiglyBT is open-source and ad-free.
    2. It offers features like Swarm Merging, web torrent support, and remote management.

Each client has its own set of features, and the best one often depends on your specific needs, such as platform compatibility, desire for a lightweight interface, or preference for open-source software.

### Is BitTorrent Open Source?

No, the official BitTorrent clients (uTorrent and BitTorrent) are not open source. These clients are owned by Rainberry, Inc. (formerly BitTorrent, Inc.), and they are proprietary software. While they are widely available in free versions, they include ads and may have bundled software, which has led some users to seek open-source alternatives like qBittorrent and Deluge, which offer similar functionalities without ads or bundled software￼.

If you’re specifically looking for open-source BitTorrent clients, options like qBittorrent, Transmission, and Deluge are popular choices within the open-source community. These alternatives provide greater transparency, customization, and freedom from ads, which appeal to users who prioritize these aspects.
