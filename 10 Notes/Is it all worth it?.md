Some remarks/questions to consider.

1. BitTorrent is old technology. Open Source BitTorrent clients also feel a bit archaic (old Boost code).
2. Is the community behind BitTorrent the community we want? Are the current BitTorrent user interested in anything else than dirty stuff? Does BitTorrent have any serious use besides streaming pirated content? Are the current BitTorrent user egger to pay? If we cannot draw constructive conclusions from those questions, then it does not really matter how many users are currently behind BitTorrent. This is even more important for the Open Source clients covering only portion of the traffic.
3. BitTorrent has a bit dark history. Also past occurrences where malware or mining software ended up on users computers. Current ad-based marketing model also makes impression that the community is maybe in worse condition than usage numbers try to cover.
4. What is the future of BitTorrent. Is the technology on its decay, or do we want to believe it is actually coming back to live (I was not really able to answer that question myself).

In the end we also need to ask what are the benefits for the BitTorrent user when enabling Codex/Marketplace integration. This is mostly the durability of the data and opportunity for storage providers to monetise, which contrasting with BitTorrent's best-effort usage.
