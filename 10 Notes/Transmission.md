[[Learn BitTorrent]] client. One of the three popular clients, the other are [[Deluge (BitTorrent)]] and [[qBittorrent]], with the most attractive looking website. Comparing to the other two, Transmission does not depend on [[libtorrent-rasterbar]], but rather has its own implementation of the BitTorrent protocol.

> As noted in GitHub’s REDME, [Transmission's documentation](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/README.md) is currently out-of-date, but the team has recently begun a new project to update it and is looking for volunteers. If you're interested, please feel free to submit pull requests!

It supports all major OS and has a native macos support.

The latest release is from 30 May 2024.
