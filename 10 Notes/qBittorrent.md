Note about macOS support:

> The macOS version is **barely supported,** because we don't have active macOS developers/contributors. 
> The project is in need of macOS developers. If you are a macOS developer willing to help, just go to our bug tracker for a list of macOS related issues. Or try to fix bugs that you yourself have discovered and annoy you.
