We can only start answering it after we:

1. Revise the Codex peer-exchange protocol and see which BitTorrent extensions we want to adopt in Codex.
2. Settle down on the which Open Source client we want to use.

Once we have this, we can start incrementally realise the Codex/BitTorrent integration. E.g. with can start with integrating Codex as it is and then incrementally add extensions we want to support. This approach would allow us to bootstrap the session management.
