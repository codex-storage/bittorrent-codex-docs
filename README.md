## BitTorrent/Codex Integration

In this repository your will find a complete documentation of our BitTorrent/Codex investigation.

## How to read this document

The most important part to read are the 3 points at the beginning of the [Objectives](#objectives) section below followed by a introductory [[Is it all worth it?]]. I tried to keep that part concise yet informative.

On the way, you will find a number references to a more detailed, sometimes low-level, and technical content. I hope this will be useful supportive information that will help us decide the next steps and assist in making more informative, strategic decisions about Codex/BitTorrent integration.

### Objectives

I was trying to answer the following questions:

1. [[How BitTorrent-Codex integration may look like? ]]
2. [[What are existing (open source) BitTorrent clients?]]
3. [[How big the effort would be?]]

Answering those three questions should give us answer to the big ultimate question: [[Is it all worth it?]]

Getting there in short time is not easy, especially without recent hands-on experience with the BitTorrent protocol. For this reason, in the quest, the following two actions has being taken:

1. Identify [[Learn BitTorrent|the best resources to learn BitTorrent protocol]], to get some intuition about the protocol. This is mostly to answer the question number (1) above.
2. [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients|Compare existing BitTorrent clients]], trying to focus on those that are open sourced. We want to learn about their market share, how do they look and feel, and how easy would it be to work with their codebase.

### Obsidian

This repository is also a complete [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. You can open it on your computer in the [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/download) and have a complete snapshot of everything I have captured when working on the subject. Comparing to bloated [Notion](https://www.notion.so), which is a great tool for procrastination rather than a tool for capturing knowledge, Obsidian let's you capture the knowledge quickly and with excellent overview of how different topic connect to each other. And in the end - all are just Markdown files.

The vault includes the `.obsidian` folder, but does not include publishing settings, and workspace configuration as those are personal and change every time you open the vault. If you want to have the full control over your Obsidian look and full, your own [[Hot-Keys|hot-keys]], [[Installed plugins|plugins]], etc, your can delete `.obsidian` or replace it with your own.

### Published site

For the duration of the project, I am also publishing the documentation at [https://publish.obsidian.md/bittorrent](https://publish.obsidian.md/bittorrent). Published site allows you to access all the docs, but it is highly recommended to use [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/download) for a complete experience. Currently, for instance, we need to duplicate note properties in a table, in order for those to be visible at the published site.

The site will be removed after conclusion has been reached.
